            Hello. My name is Ashkan Jafarzadeh. This is my very first
            small project in web developement.

        <p class="text class-two">
            As HTML and CSS are the most important language to learn in
            this context, I started with them. Then, I plan to learn about
            Flask which seems to be easy to learn, specially now that I know
            how to code in Python.
